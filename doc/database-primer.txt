Now, for the database stuff

Download Postgres 9.6.2 from https://www.postgresql.org/download/ ... Windows or
Linux doesn't matter, whatever platform you would prefer to do development. I use
mac. 

Briefly Review the manual
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/index.html... specifically the
tutorial/getting started portion   

Get pgadmin4 working and connected to your database 

Create a new user, set a password for this user

Create a new database named dropin, owned by the user you made in step 4

Now, use the terminal for the following (on linux, xterm or mac iterm) 


Use psql to log into your database

Create a new table for members (read the manual to figure out the SQL to do this). It
should have at least 5 various fields like name, phone number, address, last login,
or whatever you like. , It should have at least 2 different types of fields. It
should also have a unique primary key. (read what a primary key is and how to assign
primary keys)

Our application is a system that lets you drop in to gyms where you are not a member
of. So we will need a new table of gyms. It should have 5 various fields like name of
gym, type, cost to drop in, and whatever else you think of. It should also have a
unique primary key.

Now, the exciting part. You have to have a new table that shows what customers
dropped into what gyms on what dates. Make a new table dropins that has 2 foreign
keys, one for members and one for gyms. Add another two fields like date and
comments. Be sure to use the correct SQL types for all fields.

Next, populate your tables with some test data (add a few dummy customers, gyms, and
dropins)

Finally, use SQL to make two reports. First report lists all of today's drop ins,
second report sums the revenue from all the drop ins for today and shows us how much
money we made!!!

Where you are at right now the above will probably take you about 6-8 hours, but
please ask me for questions or help if you get stuck for more than 10-15 minutes! I
will be snowboarding Saturday during the day but can help you otherwise.

Let me see the following when you are done: 
run from psql prompt and send me the output:
\dt
\d members
\d gyms
select * from members;
select * from gyms;
select * from dropins;
your two reports along with the SQL used to create them, output should look something like this:

Report #1

  name  |     name      | price
--------+---------------+-------
 collin | Serao Academy | 22.75
 kong   | Serao Academy | 22.75
 ross   | Kongs Yoga    |    15
 jack   | FCFC          |    45
 kong   | FCFC          |    45
(5 rows)


Report #2
  sum
-------
 150.5
